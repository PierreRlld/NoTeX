Overall, rather than becoming a technical expert on a specific subject, this internship provided me with a broader view of economic subjects and ways to conduct research. 
In addition to the two projects presented in this report, I also worked on topics such as a small global trade model\cite{az_trade}; an assessment of increasing inflationâ€™s effect on sovereign debt ratio; or computing corporate profit margins and introducing a proxy for some industries\cite{az_margins}.
