First and foremost I would like to express my gratitude to Fran√ßoise Huang*, Ludovic Subran, Ana Boata, Maxime Darmet and Roberta Fortes for their confidence, guidance, teaching and unwavering support during these past six months. I also thank the whole Economic Research department and the other interns for the good time I spent there. I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to work on such diverse topics and for both the freedom and guidance I was offered while doing so.
